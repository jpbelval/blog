## Minimalistic blog

[I'm](https://github.com/jpbelval) a computer science student from Québec ⚜️ particularly interested in ML, scalability and cloud. I also have a passion for open-source. I firmly believe that by contributing together on robust software, professionals can create meaningful value for the community as a whole. 

**This blog.**

I created this blog to reinforce my understanding of technology and to satisfy my desire to write and communicate beyond software development. I want to log the evolution of my knowledge for personal reflection while developing my ideas through long-form content.
